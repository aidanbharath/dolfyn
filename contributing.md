1) Open an issue
2) Branch off of master
3) Make changes
4) Test that changes don't break/fail tests (or that failures are consistent with change)
5) Create a test that verifies the change (this should be included in your changes)
6) Make entry for change in `changelog.md`
7) Once finished create a PR (mention issue) and wait for TravisCI + AppVeyor to do checks
